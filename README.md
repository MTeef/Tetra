# Tetra
Photo Positioning Algorithm

# Alternatives
- Collinearity Equation "Matrix-Based. 
- DLT "Matrix-Base".

# Why Tetra?
- Fast, Tetra is a derivative-free "Search-Based" algorithm. 
- Work with a minimum number of Known Points (3pts->4Solutions|4pts->unique-solution).
- No calibration info was needed for it to work.
