# Tetra
Photo Positioning Algorithm

# Alternatives
- Collinearity Equation "Matrix-Based". 
- DLT "Matrix-Base".

# Why Tetra?
- Fast, Tetra is a derivative-free "Search-Based" algorithm. 
- Work with a minimum number of Known Points:
     3 Known Points result in a max of 4 solutions,
     4 Known Points give a unique-solution.
- No calibration info was needed for it to work.
